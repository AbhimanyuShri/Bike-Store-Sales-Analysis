# Bike Store Sales Analysis
This project involves a detailed analysis of three bike stores’ sales and staff (Baldwin, Santa Cruz, and Rowlett Bikes). The objective is to extract crucial insights and answer multiple business questions based on the dataset. All bike stores are owned by the same company, so it’s vital to analyze from the perspective of the company.

Insight into the best-selling brands, specific products, and categories of bikes can help advise on what items to focus on.

Analyzing revenue by staff member can give insight into who should receive promotions/awards.

Categorizing revenue by store can help the managers decide which stores to focus promotion on.

Stock analysis for each store is crucial to visualize clearly to act fast.

Visualizing revenue by year and month can help stores organize seasonal events or brainstorm strategies for growing revenue based on previous years.

Extracting consumers who shop frequently or spend a lot can help stores contact them for certain loyalty programs or rewards.
